# ChamberTempRNA: The Effects of Temperature Stress on Gene Regulation of Ostrich Chicks
In this project, I am interested in genetic underpinnings of the chicks’ thermoregulatory responses
to different temperature conditions.
## Data
The data for this project is RNA-seq data. Chicks of different age groups were subjected to three temperature treatments - hot, cold and benign - and their blood was sampled. Following RNA extraction and library preparation by PolyA enrichment, the samples were sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing.
## Scripts
This folder contains scripts for read QC, trimming, mapping and read counting
## Analysis
This folder contains scripts for differential expression analysis and WGCNA.
## Results
This folder contains scripts for generation of figures, tables etc. and some summary text files, .htmls and .pdfs
## Steps
This folder contains intermediary files for the different parts of the analysis (QC, mapping)
